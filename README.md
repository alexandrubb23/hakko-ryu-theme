## 💫 About the Inspiration

This theme was born from my personal journey with **🥋 <span style="color: #8B5CF6">Hakko Ryu Jujutsu</span>**, a martial art that has been a meaningful part of my life since 2010. <span style="color: #8B5CF6">Hakko Ryu</span>, meaning "The Style of the Eighth Light," refers to the invisible yet powerful ultraviolet band of light - much like how subtle code can have profound impact.

The 🟣 purple represents the essence of <span style="color: #8B5CF6">Hakko Ryu's</span> philosophy: strength that appears gentle, power that flows like water, and techniques that work through harmony rather than force. Combined with the 🇷🇴 <span style="color: #3B82F6">blue</span>, <span style="color: #EAB308">yellow</span>, and <span style="color: #F87171">red</span> of the <span style="color: #3B82F6">Ro</span><span style="color: #EAB308">ma</span><span style="color: #F87171">nian</span> flag, this theme reflects both my martial arts heritage and cultural identity.

Just as <span style="color: #8B5CF6">Hakko Ryu</span> emphasizes **⚡ <span style="color: #8B5CF6">datsuryoku</span>** (effortless power) and **☯️ <span style="color: #8B5CF6">harmony</span>**, this theme aims to provide a coding environment that feels natural and reduces eye strain during long development sessions.
